# Frequency Analysis Decryption Lab
* **Author(s)**: Jordan Pottruff
* **Language(s)**: Java
* **Description**: The drawback of a monoalphabetic encryption scheme, where one letter in the plaintext is always replaced by the same other letter for the ciphertext, is its vulnerability to frequency analysis of characters or words. To solve for the plaintext of the ciphertext given to me in my assignment, I created a Java class that is able to allow the client to make guesses about the rules of the cipher based off the frequency of characters that appear in the ciphertext.

* **example/\***: the example input provided to me in the assignment and the corresponding output that I found with my program.
* **src/\***: the source code for the frequency analysis tool. The class itself has a main method that allows the user to interface with its functionality on the command line.
* **INSTRUCTIONS.pdf**: the instructions for the assignment.
