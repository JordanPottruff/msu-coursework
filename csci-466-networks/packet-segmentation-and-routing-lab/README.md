# Packet Segmentation and Routing Lab
* **Author(s)**: Jordan Pottruff, Joshua Stephenson-Losey
* **Language(s)**: Python
* **Description**: Expansion of an existing network simulation to include packetizing of information, packet segmentation, and rudimentary packet forwarding using routing tables.
## Files
* **part1/\***: code for part1, packetizing of larger messages.
* **part2/\***: code for part2, builds off part1 by adding packet segmentation for routers that have smaller MTUs than the size of the packets they receieve.
* **part3/\***: code for part3, adds routing using forwarding tables onto the simulation.
* **INSTRUCTIONS.md**: instructions for the assignment.
