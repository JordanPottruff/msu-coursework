# Reliable Data Transfer Lab
* **Author(s)**: Jordan Pottruff, Carsen Ball
* **Language(s)**: Python
* **Description**: Added reliable data transfer to a network simulation with router connections that are inherently unreliable due to dropped and corrupted packets. Our reliable data transfer protocol resembles TCP and implements ACKs, NACKs, and re-transmissions.
## Files
* **RDT-1.0/\***: initial source files for RDT "1.0", which provides no reliability.
* **RDT-2.1/\***: implements RDT 2.1 which provides reliability against corrupted packets.
* **RDT-3.0/\***: implements RDT 3.0 which provides reliability against both corrupted and dropped packets.
* **INSTRUCTIONS.md**: instructions for the assignment.
