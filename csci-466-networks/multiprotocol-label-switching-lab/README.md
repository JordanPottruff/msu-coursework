# Multiprotocol Label Switching Lab
* **Author(s)**: Jordan Pottruff, Justin McGowen
* **Language(s)**: Python
* **Description**: Implementation of MPLS forwarding in a network simulation. This simulation uses a simple network topology involving only a few hosts and routers. Routers are able to communicate/route using MPLS labels, and connections to hosts rely only on network packets. 
## Files
* **images/\***: image files for the instructions.
* **part1/\***: code for part1, adds MPLSFrames for MPLS-enabled routers connections.
* **part2/\***: code for part2, includes code from part 1 and adds forwarding using the MPLS labels. 
* **part3/\***: code for part3, includes code from part 1 and 2 and adds priorities for MPLS frames in order to prevent high priority packets from being dropped during congestion.
* **INSTRUCTIONS.md**: instructions for the assignment, including the details for each part.
