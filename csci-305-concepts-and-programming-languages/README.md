# CSCI-305: Concepts & Programming Languages
**Course Description:** "an examination of several programming paradigms, and languages, as well as their application and underlying execution model. Paradigms examined include imperative, object-oriented, functional, logic and string based. Students will gain exposure to a variety of languages..."
## Assignments
* **java-lab**: uses extensive object-oriented programming to implement different strategies for the game "Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock" and simulating their interaction with one another.

* **ml-lab**: implements sets and their operations using ML, a functional language. 

* **prolog-lab**: uses Prolog to implement first-order logic rules for querying complex familial relationships given a dataset about the royal family.

* **ruby-lab**: demonstrates imperative programming by developing procedures that build off each other in order to create a program that creates song titles using bigram counts collected from a data set of one million songs.
