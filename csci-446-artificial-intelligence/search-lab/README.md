# Pacman Search Lab
* **Author(s)**: Jordan Pottruff
* **Language(s)**: Java
* **Description**: Implementation of increasingly intelligent search algorithms for finding shortest path through 'Pacman-like' mazes. Included are classical search algorithms like DFS and BFS, but also Best-First Search and A* Search, which use heuristics for more intelligent path finding. 
## Files
* **mazes/\***: example mazes that the program uses.
* **out/\***: example output on the given example mazes.
* **src/\***: the source code for the program.
* **REPORT.pdf**: my report about the implementation of the search methods and an analysis of their behavior.
