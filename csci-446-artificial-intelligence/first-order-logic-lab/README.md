# Wumpus World Lab
* **Author(s)**: Jordan Pottruff, Carsen Ball, Brett Layman
* **Language(s)**: Python, Prolog (SWI)
* **Description**: In this lab, we developed an AI that uses first-order logic to solve the famous ['Wumpus World'](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse473/06au/schedule/lect8.pdf) problem/game. To do this, we mixed procedural and logic programming by developing a Python application that relies on Prolog rules for the agent's knowledge base. Together, they create a program that can simulate wumpus worlds and their solutions.
## Files
* **maps/\***: while our program can generate random worlds, it can also read them in from text files like the ones found here.
* **out/\***: rather than setting up a python environment to run the project, you can examine an example output here.
* **src/\***: these are the source files for the AI, with wumpusWorld.py being the main driver for the program.
* **REPORT.pdf**: our final report that explains the details of our implementation and the information we discovered from it.
